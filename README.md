# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This site is a collection of reflections on various subjects.
In particular on programming, teamwork, management, entrepreneurship.

The plan is to start by dumping some of the resources collected on the web and sort them by subject. And then to work on synthesizing the subject. Writting will hopefully help structure my thoughts.
